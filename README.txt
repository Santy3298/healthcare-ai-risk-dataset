README - Multi-Modal Healthcare Dataset for AI-Based Early Disease Risk Prediction

Dataset Description:
This dataset includes synthetic healthcare records designed for developing and benchmarking AI models in patient risk stratification, vital sign monitoring, and clinical decision support. It includes time-series vitals, demographic attributes, disease risk labels, and synthetic EHR records.

Files Included:
1. vitals_time_series.csv - Hourly vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, SpO₂) for 50 patients over 24 hours
2. demographics.csv - Patient demographics and lifestyle indicators
3. disease_risk_labels.csv - Annotated labels for low, medium, and high disease risk
4. ehr_records.json - Structured synthetic EHR summaries and notes
5. data_dictionary.xlsx - Column-wise data description
6. plot_health_metrics.py - Python script for vitals visualization

Use Cases:
- Early disease risk prediction
- Clinical decision support systems
- Synthetic data for federated or privacy-preserving AI
- Medical AI benchmarking
